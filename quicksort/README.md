# Quicksort Visualizer

This project is a simple client-side application that visualizes how the quicksort algorithm works. It builds on Vite for development and bundling and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

When you click **Show Quicksort**, a random array of 30 numbers is generated and the algorithm sorts it while animating each step. You can adjust the tick slider to control the animation speed.

## Development

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
